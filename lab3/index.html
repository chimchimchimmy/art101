			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<p>This lab required us to organize the file structure for this class in our text editor, add more content in our homepage, and finish off by adding our screenshots and concluding thoughts to the Lab 3 folder.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>What was challenging about this lab was implementing the changes like adding pictures and a bulleted list, but also figuring out new things like the order of elements, making an image a background, and more.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Many problems arose. I had some issues with the images showing up, but I was able to solve this by either adding their url or putting them in the images folder and linking to them. I also couldnt figure out how to put elements to the right side of others, because simply floating them didn't do that. I'll keep trying to figure that out. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I learned more about HTML and CSS by experimenting and trying out new things. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I feel ok about the results, I think the homepage looks fine. When I learn more about how to organize things on the screen I think it'll look a lot better.</p>
