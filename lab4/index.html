				<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
				<h2>Pseudocoding a simple task: making chicken katsu</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Prep chicken breasts or tenders</li>
					<li>Crack an egg into a bowl</li>
					<li>Mix the yolk into the white</li>
					<li>Pour some panko bread crumbs into a different bowl</li>
					<li>Coat the chicken in the egg</li>
					<li>Coat the chicken in the bread crumbs</li>
					<li>Heat vegetable oil in a pan</li>
					<li>Fry the chicken for about 3 mins on medium-low heat, then flip</li>
					<li>Serve with a sauce or sriracha and rice</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Pseudocoding a game: word hunt</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Display a 5x5 grid of squares</li>
					<li>Randomly generate a letter for each square</li>
					<li>When a player drags between 2 or more letters with their finger, a line strikes through them</li>
					<li>Calculate every possible combination of words that can be made with the letters</li>
					<li>Words must be at least 3 letters long and can be found in the dictionary</li>
					<li>Players can connect every 2 letters any way vertically, horizontally, and diagonally</li>
					<li>The line between letters is red</li>
					<li>The line turns green when the player swipes over a word</li>
					<li>The player gets that word when they lift their finger</li>
					<li>Three-letter words are 100 points, four-letter words are 400 points, and each letter on adds 400 points</li>
					<li>A 1 minute timer begins counting down as soon as the game starts</li>
					<li>When the timer runs out, the scoreboard for both players are shown</li>
				</ol>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was learning how to make comments and properly indent them in JavaScript, as well as putting the information together in the HTML file for the Lab 4 site..</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problems that arose came as a result of me again trying to put an image to the right of the information on the Lab 4 page, but no matter what I tried, it didn't come out right. I'll have to keep trying new things to figure out how to do that. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The pseudocoding was not too difficult and I understand the function of it. One thing I would like to understand better is how the indentation should be done and if it matters. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I think the results of the pseudocoding came out well, and despite the fact that I couldn't get the image I wanted to format correctly on the website, the Lab 4 site still looks well-organized enough to me.</p>
