    // Randomly generate a letter for each square
      // Calculate every possible combination of words that can be made with the letters
        // Words must be at least 3 letters long and can be found in the dictionary
      // When a player drags between 2 or more letters with their finger, a line strikes through them
        // The line between letters is red
      // Players can connect every 2 letters any way vertically, horizontally, and diagonally
        // The line turns green when the player swipes over a word
      // The player gets that word when they lift their finger
      // Three-letter words are 100 points, four-letter words are 400 points, and each letter on adds 400 points
  // A 1 minute timer begins counting down as soon as the game starts
  // When the timer runs out, the scoreboard for both players are shown
