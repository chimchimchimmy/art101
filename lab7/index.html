				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>This lab's challenge was to create folders for lab 7, set up the site and link it to the homepage, and create a function in the javascript that will prompt the user to enter their name, turn that string into an arry, sort it, and then turn it back and display their shuffled name on the page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>One of the things I struggle with was getting the code right in the javascript, but I used wesbot and w3schools to help.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I feel like I learned more about strings and arrays and some of the things they can do for a website. I also like how this technique enables more user interaction.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results of the JavaScript function can be seen below. The userâ€™s name is sorted alphabetically and displayed there.</p>
