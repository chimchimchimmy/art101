				<p> Hi, this is Stephanie Lipe and my partner Coralie Norenberg! Nice to make your aquaintance. I like making art, reading, watching good shows and movies, listening to music, and learning about things like history. I'm an art and literature major, so that all makes sense. I think that life should be a constant state of learning, but I also love idle activities like hanging out with friends or going for a walk along the beach. I think those moments are equally as valuable. My partner, Coralie, likes to swim, make art (she's an art major), hang out with her roommates, listen to music, and eat good food! She agrees with me, she doesn't think learning ever stops in life, we can learn from everything and everyone around us. She tries to uphold this by being outgoing and being a good listener! We're both very excited to learn more about coding! </p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was figuring out how to change the properties of the elements on the website. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with figuring out how to center the image, but i consulted W3Schools and got the answer. I also used the examples in canvas as well as Wesbot a little bit. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment helped me understand the organization of coding better and how it works. I can see how the longer you do it, the more you would know how to do. I think I put in a good amount of effort trying to learn how it works. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I think the result of the webpage looks pretty good. There's nothing fancy, but hopefully it looks well laid-out.</p>
