                <p>The challenge of this lab was to create randomly generated text with the click of a button, and display it on the web page.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I encountered some problems getting the Javascript to work initially, but I realized I hadn't linked it correctly. It also took me a while to get the CSS to look correct, there was a lot to do.</p>

            <!-- Reflection Section with ID -->
            <div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I learned about how to make a button that produces randomly generated text and how to make it appear like text messages using css. I like the way that turned out, I think it looks pretty cool.</p>
