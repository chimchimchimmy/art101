                    <p>The challenge of this lab was to use the console to fix bugs from other labs.</p>

                    <p>My lab 12 wasn't working to sort out full names, it would just say undefined, so I had to look at the console to see what was wrong. It said that the crossOriginIsolated.log was the problem so I changed it to console.log. </p>

                    <h2>Debugging</h2>
                    <p>Below is the working code for the lab. In addition to having to change crossOriginIsolated.log to console.log, I also apparently had a syntax error. For the "else if (mod == 3) {
                     return "HUFFLEPUFF"
                    }"" part, I had (mod ==2), so that made it unable to return both Slytherin and Hufflepuff. I noticed that just by looking at the code quickly though and fixed it.</p>
