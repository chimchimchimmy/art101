                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function that uses conditionals to return a different answer of one of the Harry Potter houses depending on the name a person types in the box. </p> 
            </div>

            <!-- Problems Section -->
            <div class="minor-section" id="problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>At first, the button wasn't working to reurn one of the answers, so I looked closely at the JS and found a couple syntax errors. It worked after I fixed those.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Reflection Section -->
            <div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This function is pretty cool and I could see it being useful, but it's also fun to make it into a sort of game like this.</p> 
            </div>

            <!-- Results Section -->
            <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The results of the lab can be seen below. It's pretty basic, but hey, it works.</p>
